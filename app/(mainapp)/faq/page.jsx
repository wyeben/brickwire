            <ToggleFAQ question='How liquid is the investment?'>
              <motion.p className='text-sm text-[#798699]'>
                The investment is as liquid as owning a property. When you
                invest in short-let apartment, the goal isnâ€™t usually liquidity
                but return on investment, which further increases as the
                property appreciates. However, in this case, there is a ready
                community of buyers. The developer has the right of first
                refusal, but the investor is free to sell to a 3rd party if they
                get a higher offer elsewhere.
